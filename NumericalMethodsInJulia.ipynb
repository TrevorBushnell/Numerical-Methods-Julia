    "### Bisection Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The bisection method is a consequence of the IVT (Intermediate Value Theorem) from calculus. Essentially, if $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ are of opposite sign, then we are guaranteed that there is some point in the interval $(a,b)$ such that the output of $f$ is 0. The algorithm uses this fact to shrink the length of the interval until the root is found.\n",

    "> 1. Let $x_0 = \\frac{b+a}{2}$. Check $f(x_0)$ and update $b_1 = x_0$, $a_1 = x_0$\n",
    "> 2. Let $x_1 = \\frac{b_1+a_1}{2}$. Check $f(x_0)$ and update $b_2 = b_1$, $a_3 = x_2$\n",
